# RateYourMusic
I was interested in learning how to create my own datasets using data from the web, so I embarked on this project.
This is an end-to-end data analysis project using the popular music reviewing website RateYourMusic.com.
I scraped their Most Popular Albums chart, cleaned it up, performed some analysis, and created a dashboard of visualizations.
I used various R packages to complete this project, including rvest, tidyverse, wordcloud, ggplot, plotly, and flexdashboard.
The dataset was shared on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tobennao/rym-top-5000).
The dashboard was published to RPubs (https://rpubs.com/okanitobe/887911).
This repository contains the reference scripts/markdowns with which I created to make the finished products referenced above.
